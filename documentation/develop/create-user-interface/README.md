#### Create User Roles

Now, you can create roles to define different authorization for your application. For example you might want to ensure that some people can view data, but are not able to edit them.

1. Go back to the home page of the application. Find the **[User Roles](https://help.sap.com/docs/Application%20Development/6a5fc562f6e2402aa84b0416614a05fc/369ed9cc7a724cfcb2bdbe20f8b6e7d6.html?locale=en-US)** tile and choose the **+** icon to add a new role.

2. Enter a role name, for example, _RiskViewer_. Enter a description and choose **Read** as **Privilege Defaults**. Choose **Save**.
